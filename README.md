Pack your application along with all its dependencies into a single executable!
The original application does not have to be statically linked.

## Important

* The generated executable is not compatible with [upx](https://upx.github.io/)
(but you can use upx on any input executables)
* Although this software is intended to be cross-platform, I would highly recommend using
[AppImage](https://appimage.org/) if you are on Linux.
